message=There was an article in the paper last week about he 50th anniversary of the song "Imagine" by John Lennnon.  The drummer on the song was Alan White who went on later to Yes.  It said 200 artist have done covers.  I've done one in my studio where I recorded all the instruments: https://soundcloud.com/boomboomdrums/imagine  Here is a picture of me and Alan in 2008 when I was in the Sounders band: https://www.flickr.com/photos/reddogblitz/51256470270/  Have a nice weekend!
